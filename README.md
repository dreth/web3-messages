# Web3 messages

Simple vanilla JS app with a node+express server-side backend that allows posting messages to server storage (a JSON file) and to the blockchain (a smart contract on Rinkeby).

Contracts are in `/contracts` but they are also live on rinkeby [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8d39da7823d0bec131ed7cd84f29fb1ec6f96269#code).

See the app running live on: **https://web3-messages-express.herokuapp.com/**
